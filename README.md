Titanic Classification Project
Welcome to the Titanic Classification project! This repository contains a Python-based solution to the classic Titanic survival prediction problem using various data science techniques. The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features such as age, gender, class, and other available information.

Project Overview
This project aims to solve the Titanic classification problem using machine learning techniques. The task is to predict the survival status of passengers on the Titanic using the provided dataset. The project covers the entire data science workflow, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the well-known Titanic dataset, which is available on Kaggle. It includes the following files:
train.csv: The training dataset containing features and labels (survived or not).
test.csv: The testing dataset containing features without labels.
gender_submission.csv: A sample submission file in the correct format.

Requirements
To run this project, you'll need the following Python packages:
Python
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
Google Colab

Model Evaluation
The models are evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score. The best model is selected based on these metrics and is used for making predictions on the test dataset.
